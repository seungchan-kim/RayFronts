## Adding a Dataset
0. Read the [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
1. Create a new python file with the same name as your dataset.
2. Extend one of the base abstract classes found in [base.py](base.py).
3. Implement and override the inherited methods.
4. Add a config file with all your constructor arguments in configs/dataset. 
5. import your encoder in the datasets/__init__.py file.
6. Edit this README to include your new addition.
